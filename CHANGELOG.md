## 4.12.1

## 4.12.0

### Breaking Changes
- Updated `chromedriver` dependency to version 81, which requires Node 10
- Updated minimum requirement to `Node 10` from `Node 8`

### Fix

- Instantiate and injects `nemo` into context on the global `beforeEach` hook when `driverPerTest` is `true`
- Updated dependency to Mocha 7.1.1 since that is the version that fixes start event firing too early, before it can be monitored. https://github.com/mochajs/mocha/issues/2753

### Fixes

- added post `npm test` verification of report directories/files type/count
